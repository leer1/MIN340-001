        <h3>What is your favorite book?</h3>
        
        <p>My favorite book is Brave New World by Aldous Huxley. I had to read this specific book for my AP English class as part of our monthly reading.</p>

        <h3>What is your favorite movie/TVShow?</h3>
        
        <p>My favorite movie is Intersteller. This movie was just found randomly on Hulu and with some free time on my hands from summer break, I went and watched it. As for my favorite TV show, I'd have to say Burn Notice as it was all I watched when I was in high school.</p>

        <h3>What is your favorite food?</h3>
        
        <p>My favorite food is the gyro wrap. I don't know what it is, but the Greeks have it right! I used to dislike Greek good, mainly because I was never into exploring other food, but when I was forced to try it one time and I enjoyed it! It is literally their version of hamburgers and fries.</p>

                <div id="box4">
        <h3>What is your favorite musician/music?</h3>
        
        <p>I honestly cannot say that I have a specific favorite, as I like all kinds of music, but if I had to name a genre at least, I'd say folk/alternative. Some of the groups that I like that play this genre are Portugal. The Man and Modest Mouse to name a couple. I have always listened to his genre along with electronic dance music, heavy metal, and believe it or not, jazz.</p>

        <h3>What is your favorite color?</h3>
        
        <p>My favorite color is blue. I have always liked blue, specifically the color blue right before violet. I also love the colors orange and purple as they both symble purity to me.</p>

                <div id="box6">
        <h3>What is your solution to feel better when you get down?</h3>
        
        <p>Graphic designing and <a href="mailto:leer1@mymail.nku.edu?Subject=Hello%20world">storm chasing</a> are my main hobbies that I go after whenever I am down. Storm chasing is like a mini-vacation for me and puts my mind at ease watching mother nature.</p>

                <div id="box6">
        <h3>What makes you happy these days?</h3>
        
        <p>Honestly, just being alive is what makes me happy. Also, the fact that I am almost done with school - I still have two more semesters left of my undergad, and hopefully within the next two years, I will be living in my own house.</p>

        <h3>What is something interesting and unique about you?</h3>
        
        <p>I am a full time storm chaser and hail researcher for THOR Storm Team that is in Bowling Green Kentucky. What I essentially do is collect and observe hail samples to collect data on hail size that will help further enhance our hail detecting technology in weather observations and forecasting. No, I have not seen a tornado, yet, but I have been chased down by one in Illinois in the dark, and I've mainly seen really large hail, the usual damaging winds and crazy storm structures.</p>
